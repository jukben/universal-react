- [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/) for Haskell-like functional swag üèÑ
- [Redux-Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) for persisting data for user

## Tests
Testing powered by [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) including async Epics testing even with HTTP mocks. Check out the `__tests__` folders.

## Development
Using [ESlint Airbnb config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbn) for linting code along with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and [FlowType](https://typeflow.org) for type checking. There is already automatic precommit flow that checks code validity for you.
